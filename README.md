## Dataset Details

### Gothic (`data/gothic/`)

| File | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `got.pretrained.pth` | [DecipherUnsegmented](https://github.com/j-luo93/DecipherUnsegmented) | Pretrained phonological embeddings trained on Gothic IPA data |
| `segments.pkl` | [DecipherUnsegmented](https://github.com/j-luo93/DecipherUnsegmented) | Serialized phonetic segment inventory |
| `gotica.txt` | [Wulfila Project](https://www.wulfila.be/gothic/download/) | Plain text of the Gothic Bible (4th century CE translation by Bishop Wulfila) |
| `gotica.xml.zip` | [Wulfila Project](https://www.wulfila.be/gothic/download/) | TEI P5 XML encoding with linguistic annotations |

The Gothic Bible is the primary source of Gothic text. The paper uses unsegmented Gothic inscriptions from the 3rd-10th century AD period.

### Ugaritic (`data/ugaritic/`)

| File | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `uga-heb.no_spe.cog` | [NeuroDecipher](https://github.com/j-luo93/NeuroDecipher) | Full Ugaritic-Hebrew cognate pairs |
| `uga-heb.small.no_spe.cog` | [NeuroDecipher](https://github.com/j-luo93/NeuroDecipher) | ~10% training subset |

**Format:** Tab-separated values. Each row is a cognate pair. Column 1 = Ugaritic transliteration, Column 2 = Hebrew transliteration. `|` separates multiple cognates; `_` marks missing entries. Originally from Snyder et al. (2010), covering 7,353 segmented tokens from the 14th-12th century BC.

### Iberian (`data/iberian/`)

| File | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `iberian.csv` | [DecipherUnsegmented](https://github.com/j-luo93/DecipherUnsegmented) | Cleaned epigraphic inscriptions |

**Format:** CSV with columns `REF. HESPERIA` (inscription reference code) and `cleaned` (transcribed text). Contains 3,466 undersegmented character chunks from the 6th-1st century BC. Sourced from the [Hesperia database](http://hesperia.ucm.es/en/proyecto_hesperia.php) and cleaned via the authors' Jupyter notebook.

### Cited Sources (`data/cited_sources/`)

These are external datasets referenced in the paper for known-language vocabularies and comparison:

| File | Citation | Usage in Paper |
|---|---|---|
| `genesis/Hebrew.xml` | Christodouloupoulos & Steedman (2015) | Hebrew vocabulary for Ugaritic comparison |
| `genesis/Latin.xml` | Christodouloupoulos & Steedman (2015) | Latin vocabulary for cross-linguistic comparison |
| `basque/Basque-NT.xml` | Christodouloupoulos & Steedman (2015) | Basque vocabulary for Iberian comparison |
| `basque/Trask_Etymological_Dictionary_Basque.pdf` | Trask (2008) | Basque etymological data |
| `iberian_names/RodriguezRamos2014.pdf` | Rodriguez Ramos (2014) | Iberian personal name lists with Latin correspondences |

The Bible texts are from the [Massively Parallel Bible Corpus](https://github.com/christos-c/bible-corpus) (CC0 licensed).
